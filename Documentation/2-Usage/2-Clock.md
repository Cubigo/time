# Clock

The fundamental entry point for retrieving calendrical values is via a `Clock`. In the real world, whenever we want to know what time it is, we look at a clock on a wall or on a wrist.

The simplest way to retrieve a `Clock` in the package is to ask for the `system` clock:

```swift
let clock = Clocks.system
```

The `system` clock follows the user-visible time on the current device. It is automatically initialized with the user's current locale, calendar, and time zone.

With the `Clock` instance in-hand, you can begin asking it for current time values:

```swift
// retrieve the current instantaneous time from the clock
let now = clock.thisInstant()
```

Since the `Clock` is initialized with the user's current `Region`, you can also use it to retrieve region-specific values:

```swift
// retrieve the current calendar day, as defined by the user's region
// this represents the range of Instants in "today"
let today = clock.today()
```

With these values in-hand, you can begin using them as the basis for performing calculations or generating UI values to show to the user.

## Injecting Time

By defining the concept of a "Clock" as the way to retrieve calendrical values, we allow for much easier dependency injection of value generation.

Imagine an app that's meant to be used in conjunction with a specific event, or an app that otherwise alters its behavior depending on the time of day (such as "make this functionality available after 3pm").

If an app is using `Date()` or `[NSDate new]` as the mechanism for know what time it is "now", then validating behavioral changes based on that time becomes very difficult. 

By instead relying on a `Clock`, altering the current notion of "time" becomes much simpler. Simply provide a `Clock` instance to the parts of your app that determine behavior, and then you have a way to *change the clock*. Just like you can walk over to a clock on the wall and manually change where its hands are pointing, you can do the same to a `Clock` instance.

`Clock` provides several methods for constructing new or derivative clocks with altered time:

```swift
// this creates a Clock that is always 42 seconds ahead of the system clock
let offsetClock = aClock.offset(by: 42.0)
```

```swift
let now = Clocks.system.thisInstant()

// this creates a clock that, from this point onwards, pretends that 2 seconds have passed for every second that has passed in real time 
let fastClock = Clocks.custom(startingFrom: now, rate: 2.0, region: .current)
```

So if you wanted to see how your app behaves as it approaches 3 PM, you can construct a custom clock to start counting time from "today at 3 PM" and provide it to your code.

## Converting Between Regions

`Clock` also has methods for building clocks in regions that are different from the current region.

For example, if you have the current system clock, but you *also* want to know what the "current time" is in another part of the world, `Time` makes this trivially easy:

```swift

let nycTimeZone = TimeZone(identifier: "America/New_York")!

let myClock = Clocks.system
let nycClock = myClock.converting(to: nycTimeZone)

let myLocalTime = myClock.thisMinute() // ex: 28 Feb 2020 at 3:14 PM Pacific Time

let nycLocalTime = nycClock.thisMinute() // ex: 28 Feb 2020 at 6:14 PM Eastern Time
```

## Custom Clocks

The `Clock` type is a protocol, and Time provides several different implementations to account for varying regions, scaled time, and offset time. You are welcome to create your own `Clock`-conforming types. Having a custom clock can make unit testing and debugging extremely easy, as a proper implementation would allow you to instanteously jump forwards or backwards through time, or explicitly set what "now" is, and so on.
